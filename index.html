                            I was born in Pretoria, South Africa and lived there until I was eight years old. My family then relocated to Auckland, New Zealand, where I finished primary school and attended high school. My family moved once again to Cairns, Australia, where I attended my final year of schooling. I have dabbled in several different tertiary pursuits, but due to a broad range of interests, every avenue felt like it was closing the door on others. I am very interested in a very broad range of topics related to science, technology, and philosophy. I would love to combine a degree in science with IT.

                        <h3 class="question">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
                        <p>
                            In 1994 my father brought home a decomissioned IBM PS2 286 from work for me to tinker with. I was already very interested in how things worked, perhaps this was why he thought it best suited for me. This PC had nothing more than the DOS command line, definitely no internet. I would spend a lot of time trying to determine exactly what I could do with this machine, which included me buying 286 compatible 3.5 inch floppy disk games and programs from clearance bins. Seeing that I had an interest in technology my parents, without any request from me, bought me a Sony Playstation very early after their first release. Coming from a 286 with limited VGA gaming, my mind was obviously blown. Shortly thereafter we got a new Hewlett Packard Desktop PC, with the internet! In the following years I taught myself how to code, html, css, javascript, and php. I landed up doing PC repairs for people and decided to get a job in this area. After realizing I was more interested in coding, I pursued a career as a web developer, but alas after a while this felt too limited in scope to truly make my mark on the world.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="question">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
                        <p>Having attempted to be a web developer, mostly self taught, I realized there were often times where my knowledge fell short and was untimately incomplete. Hence, I decided to come to RMIT for a number of reasons. Firstly, to fill in the afformentioned knowledge gaps and build upon them. Secondly, to develop an ethic for learning and adapting, specifically with regard to technology. Finally, for the structured and highly focused education outlined by expert academics in the field of IT.</p>
                        <h3 class="question">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
                        <p>I would like to develop a broad range of understanding in IT, both theoretical and practical. Hence, I would like to become proficient in programming and software development. Understanding the paradigms of programming and data manipulation and an ability to adapt them readily to new languages, frameworks, and software if required. Additionally, I would like to learn to collaborate with others to achieve objectives, especially those that require parallelism for expeditiosness.</p>

                            The use of data, usually large sets, to help machines/systems make the best decisions decisions for an organization for a particular purpose. In this instance, it would be helping Woolworths improve CRM, instore and online efficiencies, customer targeting, etc. This appeals to me because the next industrial revolution, which is already upon us, is predicated on artificial intelligence and being at the forefront will allow one to take full advantage of the consequent emerging opportunities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The position requires an applicant to be able to design and build a state-of-the-art machine learning platform collaboratibvely with other ML developers and data scientists. Hence, the skills include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extremely good communication</li>
                            <li>Focus with attention to detail</li>
                            <li>Well understood deligation of objectives and workload</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The qualifications and experience for this position include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bacherlors degree or above in Computer science</li>
                            <li>Two or more years of commercial software development</li>
                            <li>Well versed in popular AI/ML associated programming languages and SQL</li>
                            <li>Good grasp of Unix systems</li>
                            <li>Strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms</li>
                            <li>Practical experience with developing production grade ML projects</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In terms of skills, as I have laid it out above, I have largely worked on projects alone, except for interactions with customers about their requirements. </p>
                        <p>In terms of qualifications, I currently have only two of the above-mentioned. Firstly, I have a decent understanding of Python and SQL. Secondly, I have been using linux desktops on and off for many years and have dealt with the linux command line for several different tasks</p>
                        <p>To obtain the requisite skills to become a machine learning engineer I would need to do the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Complete bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, taking electives such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Advanced Programming Techniques</li>
                                    <li>Cloud Computing</li>
                                    <li>Unix Systems Administration and Programming</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Because ML is a data science it is dependent on statistics and calculus. Thus, I would need to find classes or courses in descriptive and inferential statistics, calculus, and linear algebra.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Take short courses in AI and potentially more specifically ML. RMIT offers Future Skills Short Courses in AI Programming with Python, Develoiping AI Strategy, and Intro to Machine Learning. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Obtain an entry level software development job, hopefuly with some focus on ML. Develop a range of skills over a number of years.
